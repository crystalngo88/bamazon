# What the project does
Upon opening Bamazon, the user is prompted to either BUY or SELL something. 

# BUY
If the user wants to buy something, they will be shown a list of items in the store inventory along with the current number of items available. User selects an item and how many they would like to buy. Bamazon will then check the inventory to see if there is enough available. If yes, then the user is able to buy the quantity requested and given a receipt, then the Bamazon Storefront is updated with the new product count. If the user wants to buy more than what is available, they will receive an error message.

# SELL
If the user wants to sell something, they will be given a series of questions to answer, which will then be added to the Bamazon database. They will need to have a product name, a category, a price per item, and how many are available for purchase.
